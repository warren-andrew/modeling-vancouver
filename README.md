# Clustering Culinary Cuisines in Vancouver, British Columbia

Motivation:
* Are certain types of cuisines more represented in some areas than in others?
* And can we group areas in Vancouver based on its most popular cuisines?

Potential impacts:
* Travelers could use the results to identify areas of interest when dining out
* Restauranteurs could use the results to identify areas to avoid that might be saturated with a particular cuisine

Data: Yelp data from 2015 found at https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset

Tools used:
* Scikit-learn NMF Topic Modeling
* Scikit-learn KMeans Clustering
* Pandas
* Data visualization packages: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh
